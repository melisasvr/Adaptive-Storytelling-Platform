1. **Clone or download** the project files
2. **Ensure Python is installed** on your system
3. **Open the project directory** in your terminal

### Running the Platform
#### Web Interface
1. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser
2. **Start interacting** with the story by making choices
3. **Watch the platform adapt** to your preferences

#### Backend Demo
```bash
python storytelling.py
```

This will run a console demo showing the AI agents in action.

## 🎮 How to Use
### Making Choices
1. **Type custom choices** in the text input field
2. **Use quick-choice buttons** for common story directions
3. **Press Enter** or click "Submit Custom Choice" to proceed

### Understanding the Interface
- **Story Panel**: Displays the current narrative and character dialogue
- **Mood Indicator**: Shows your current detected mood and engagement level
- **Visual Style**: Displays the current color palette and atmosphere
- **Recommendations**: AI-generated suggestions based on your preferences
- **Journey Stats**: Tracks your progress, choices made, and time invested

### Mood System
The platform detects 7 different moods based on your choices:

- 🌲 **Adventurous**: Exploration and discovery
- 🔍 **Mysterious**: Investigation and secrets
- 💕 **Romantic**: Love and relationships
- 🌙 **Dark**: Danger and suspense
- 😄 **Humorous**: Comedy and fun
- 🤔 **Contemplative**: Reflection and wisdom
- ⚡ **Tense**: Action and urgency

## 🔧 Customization

### Adding New Story Content
Edit `storytelling.py` to add new:
- **Characters** with different traits and moods
- **Locations** with atmospheric descriptions
- **Items** with special properties
- **Story templates** for different narrative types

### Modifying Visual Styles
Update the `moodStyles` object in `index.html` to customize:
- **Color palettes** for different moods
- **Lighting effects** and atmosphere descriptions
- **Animation speeds** and particle effects

### Extending Functionality
The modular architecture allows easy extension:
- **Add new mood types** by extending the Mood enum
- **Create custom agents** for specialized content generation
- **Implement new recommendation algorithms**
- **Add multiplayer or social features**

## 🧪 Example Usage

```python
# Initialize the platform
platform = AdaptiveStorytellingPlatform()

# Create a user profile
user_profile = platform.create_user("user123")

# Process a user choice
result = platform.process_user_choice(
    "user123", 
    "I want to explore the mysterious forest", 
    response_time=2.5
)

# Generate adaptive content
content = platform.generate_adaptive_content("user123")
print(f"Generated story: {content['narrative']}")
print(f"Character says: {content['dialogue']}")
```
